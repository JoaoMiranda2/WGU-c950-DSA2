# WGUPS Routing Program

This repository contains the implementation of the WGUPS Routing Program, a project for the C950 Data Structures and Algorithms II course at Western Governors University. The program simulates an optimized package delivery system, ensuring timely deliveries while minimizing mileage.

---

## Features

- **Custom Hash Table**: Efficient storage and retrieval of package data.
- **Routing Algorithm**: Self-adjusting algorithm inspired by the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to optimize delivery routes.
- **User Interface**: Command-line interface (CLI) for real-time package tracking and total mileage reporting.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increased packages and dynamic updates.
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Includes strengths, weaknesses, and comparisons with alternative algorithms.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure the latest version of Python is installed.
- **Libraries**: Only uses standard Python libraries (`datetime`, `csv`).
- **Data Files**: Includes CSV files for package and distance data.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wgups-routing-program.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd wgups-routing-program

3. Run the program:
python main.py

---

## Usage

- Start the program and follow the CLI prompts.
- Check the status of packages at specific times.
- View total mileage traveled by delivery trucks.

---

## Highlights

### Hash Table
- Stores package data like ID, delivery address, deadline, city, zip code, weight, and status.

### Routing Algorithm
- Optimized for efficient route calculation and delivery deadlines.
- Manages constraints like limited mileage and package corrections.

## Screenshots

- **Interface**: Real-time package status and mileage tracking.
- **Hash Table**: Data storage implementation.
- **Routing Output**: Optimized routes and delivery confirmations.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced usability.
- Implement advanced algorithms like A* or Dijkstraâ€™s for further optimization.
- Expand the system to handle real-time traffic data.
